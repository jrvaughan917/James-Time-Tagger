# James-Time-Tagger

This program takes a sample text of any length as an input. 

It then iterates through the text and looks for any date-related phrases such as "Monday", a year such as "2006", 
time-related words such as "was" or "during" or "hour" and so forth.

The program doesn't modify the input text, but it creates a separate output text where each date-related phrase is 
marked with "<<<" and ">>>" tags, and each phrase is also annotated with the type of date phrase it is.

See the sample input file, which was a randomly chosen wikipedia article, and the subsequent output file.
